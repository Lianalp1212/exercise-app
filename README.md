# Exercise App
## App description
This app was designed to help users track their workouts. Users can track the duration of a run or plank. Additionally, they can count how many push ups or squats they completed. The app makes use of a stop watch feature and an incrementer. 

Included on the home screen, there is a motivational quote randomizer that can help the user gain motivation to finish their work out. When the user clicks the "Get Quote" button a new quote will be generated.

Finally, there is a feedback section which asks the user three questions. Two questions use the Likert Scale model with a range of "Very Helpful/Likey" to "Very Unhelpful/Unlikely." The final question is an open response where the user may leave any other feedback for the app.

## My contributions
This app was based off a Mobile Development class project. I further extended the app by creating the motivational quote randomizer and the feedback section of the app.
